Bored of looking at the same old computer wallpaper? This app automatically refreshes your wallpaper with incredible art found on /r/art

Notes:
The script pulls username,password, and client secret and id from an external file.
This script should be ran before shutting the computer down, that way the registry can be freshly read when restarting computer.
